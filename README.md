# Portfolio Webpage

This is my personal portfolio webpage showcasing my work, skills, and experience. The webpage is designed to present a professional and modern look while providing easy navigation and a pleasant user experience. It includes various sections such as an About Me section, a Gallery for showcasing my projects, a Contact section for reaching out to me, and a Footer with social media links.

# Theme

The chosen theme for this portfolio webpage is a clean and elegant design with a subtle color scheme. The background color is a warm tone (#f4eee0) that creates a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. The text color (#393646) ensures good readability and contrast. The selected fonts from Google Fonts (Open Sans, Montserrat, Lato, Raleway, Roboto) add a touch of sophistication and readability to the content.

# Additional Features

In addition to the basic sections commonly found in portfolio webpages, I have implemented some additional features to enhance the overall functionality and aesthetics:

    Responsive Design: The webpage is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It utilizes media queries to provide an optimal layout and user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

    Image Gallery: The Gallery section uses a grid layout to showcase my projects. The images have a hover effect that scales them slightly to provide visual feedback and improve interactivity.

    Slider: The webpage includes a slider feature (identified with the #slider ID) that allows the display of images or content in a slide format. This can be useful for highlighting specific projects or presenting a slideshow of images.

    Smooth Animations: The webpage incorporates fade-in animations for certain elements (identified with the .fade-in class) to add a touch of elegance and bring attention to important content.

    Form Styling: The contact form (identified with the <form> element) is styled to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. It includes error message display and validation styling (.error-message and .error classes) for enhancing form usability.

Feel free to explore the webpage and get in touch with me using the contact form or the provided social media links in the footer.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio webpage!
