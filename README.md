# Portfolio Webpage

This is my personal portfolio webpage showcasing my photography work, skills, and experience. The webpage is designed to present a professional and modern look while providing easy navigation and a pleasant user experience. It includes various sections such as an About Me section, a Gallery for showcasing my projects, a Contact section for reaching out to me, and a Footer with social media links.

# Theme

The chosen theme for this portfolio webpage is a clean and elegant design with a subtle color scheme. The background color is a warm tone (#f4eee0) that creates a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. The text color (#393646) ensures good readability and contrast. The selected fonts from Google Fonts (Open Sans, Montserrat, Lato, Raleway, Roboto) add a touch of sophistication and readability to the content.

# Technologies Used

HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the web pages, including sections, headings, images, and forms.

CSS: Styles the website's appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

JavaScript: Enhances user interactivity and dynamic behavior, such as the image slider and the "Show More" button.

PHP: Handles server-side scripting, including database connections and form submissions for the Contact section.

MySQL (Database): Stores and manages data, such as user submissions and achievements. Implemented the database using WAMPServer.

# Additional Features

In addition to the basic sections commonly found in portfolio webpages, I have implemented some additional features to enhance the overall functionality and aesthetics:

    Slider: The webpage features an image slider that automatically cycles through a set of images. It adds visual interest and allows the user to showcase multiple project images or photographs.

    Toggle Button: The "Show More" button provides a way to reveal additional information or content when clicked. It helps to keep the initial design clean and concise while allowing users to access more details if desired.

    Smooth Scroll: The navigation links enable smooth scrolling to the corresponding sections of the webpage. It enhances the user experience by providing a seamless transition between different sections of the portfolio.

    Portfolio Image Hover Effect: When hovering over the portfolio images, they subtly scale up to create a visually engaging effect. This effect adds interactivity and draws attention to the projects.

    Fade-in Animation: The webpage includes a fade-in animation for certain elements as they come into the viewport. This animation creates a smooth transition and improves the overall visual appeal of the webpage.

    Contact Form Validation: The contact form includes validation for the name and email inputs. It ensures that the form is properly filled before submission, reducing the chance of errors or incomplete submissions.

    Error Handling: If any validation fails, error messages are displayed to inform the user about the specific issues. The input fields with errors are highlighted, making it easier for users to identify and correct their mistakes.

    Form Submission: After successful validation, a simple alert message confirms that the form has been submitted. The contact form is then reset, ready for a new submission.

Feel free to explore the webpage and get in touch with me using the contact form or the provided social media links in the footer.
